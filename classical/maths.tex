    \section{Primitive Notions}

    Let there be \emph{sets}.

    Let there be a binary relation called \emph{membership}, $\in$. When $x \in y$ holds, we say $x$ is a
    \emph{member} or \emph{element} of $y$. We write $x \notin y$ iff $x$ is not a member of $y$.

    \section{The Axioms}

    \begin{axiom}[Extensionality]
        If two sets have exactly the same members, then they are equal.
    \end{axiom}

    %TODO Justify these definitions

    \begin{definition}[Empty Set]
        The \emph{empty set}, $\emptyset$, is the set with no elements.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        Given objects $x_1$, \ldots, $x_n$, we write $\{ x_1, \ldots, x_n \}$ for the set whose elements are
        exactly $x_1$, \ldots, $x_n$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Union]
        The \emph{union} of sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cup B$, is the set whose elements are exactly the things
        that are members of $A$ or members of $B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Intersection]
        The \emph{intersection} of sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cap B$, is the set whose elements are exactly the
        things that are members of both $A$ and $B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Disjoint]
        Two sets $A$ and $B$ are \emph{disjoint} iff they have no common members.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Subset]
        A set $A$ is a \emph{subset} of a set $B$ or is \emph{included} in $B$, $A \subseteq B$, iff every
        member of $A$ is a member of $B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
        For any set $A$ we have $A \subseteq A$.
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{proof}
        \pf\ Every member of $A$ is a member of $A$. \qed
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proposition}
        For any sets $A$, $B$ and $C$, if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ then $A \subseteq C$.
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{proof}
        \pf\ If every element of $A$ is an element of $B$, and every element of $B$ is an element of $C$,
        then every element of $A$ is an element of $C$. \qed
    \end{proof}
    
    \begin{proposition}
        For any set $A$ we have $\emptyset \subseteq A$.
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{proof}
        \pf\ Vacuously, every member of $\emptyset$ is a member of $A$. \qed
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}[Power Set]
        The \emph{power set} of $A$, $\mathcal{P} A$, is the set whose elements are the subsets of $A$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Abstraction]
        Given a property $P(x)$, we write $\{ x \mid P(x) \}$ for the set whose elements are all the objects
        $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true.
    \end{definition}
