\begin{thm}[Brouwer Retraction Theorem]
    Let $j : \{0, 1\} \rightarrow I$ be the inclusion. Then $j$ has no continuous retraction.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Brouwer Retraction Theorem]
    Let $j : C \rightarrow D$ be the inclusion of the circle in the disk. Then $j$ has no continuous retraction.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Brouwer Retraction Theorem]
    Let $j : S \rightarrow B$ be the inclusion of the sphere in the ball. Then $j$ has no continuous retraction.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $A$, $S$ and $B$ be objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$. Let $h : A \rightarrow B$,
    $j : S \rightarrow B$, $p : A \rightarrow S$ with $jp = h$. Suppose that, for any $a : S \rightarrow A$ and
    $s : S \rightarrow S$, if $ha = js$ then $pa = s$. Let $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ and assume
    $h \alpha j = j$. Then $p \alpha$ is a retraction for $j$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    \pf\ We have $h (\alpha j) = j 1$ and so $p (\alpha j) = 1$. \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Let $A$, $S$ and $B$ be objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$. Let $h : A \rightarrow B$,
    $j : S \rightarrow B$, $p : A \rightarrow S$ with $jp = h$. Suppose that, for any $a : S \rightarrow A$ and
    $s : S \rightarrow S$, if $ha = js$ then $pa = s$. Let $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ and assume
    $h \alpha = 1$. Then $p \alpha$ is a retraction for $j$.
\end{cor}

\begin{thm}
    Let $A$, $S$ and $B$ be objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a terminal object $1$. Let
    $h : A \rightarrow B$,
    $j : S \rightarrow B$, $p : A \rightarrow S$ with $jp = h$. Assume:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        for any $a : S \rightarrow A$ and
    $s : S \rightarrow S$, if $ha = js$ then $pa = s$. 
    \item For any maps $f, g : B \rightarrow B$, either there exists $t : 1 \rightarrow B$ such that
    $ft = gt$, or there exists $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ such that $h \alpha = g$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Let $f, g : B \rightarrow B$ with $gj = j$. Then either there is a point $b : 1 \rightarrow B$ with
    $fb = gb$, or $j$ has a retraction.    
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    \pf\ By the second hypothesis, either there exists $b : 1 \rightarrow B$ such that $fb = gb$, or
    there exists $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ such that $h \alpha = g$. In the latter case, we have
    \begin{align*}
        h \alpha j & = gj \\
        & = j \\
        \therefore p \alpha j & = 1 & (\text{Hypothesis 1})
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $p \alpha$ is a retraction for $j$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    \label{cor:Brouwer}
    Let $A$, $S$ and $B$ be objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a terminal object $1$. Let
    $h : A \rightarrow B$,
    $j : S \rightarrow B$, $p : A \rightarrow S$ with $jp = h$. Assume:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        for any $a : S \rightarrow A$ and
    $s : S \rightarrow S$, if $ha = js$ then $pa = s$. 
    \item For any maps $f, g : B \rightarrow B$, either there exists $t : 1 \rightarrow B$ such that
    $ft = gt$, or there exists $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ such that $h \alpha = g$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then either $j$ has a retraction, or any map $f : B \rightarrow B$ has a fixed point.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    \pf\ Take $g = 1_B$ in the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem]
    Let $I$ be the line segment. Every continuous endomap $I \rightarrow I$ has a fixed point.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    \pf\ Apply Corollary \ref{corollary:Brouwer} with $S = \{ 0,1 \}$, $B = I$ and $A$ the set of all
    directed line segments in $I$ of length $> 0$. Let $h : A \rightarrow B$ map any directed line segment to its head,
    $j : S \rightarrow A$ be the inclusion, and $p : A \rightarrow S$ be defined by $p(a) = 0$
    if $a$ points to the left, $1$ if $a$ points to the right.

    Hypothesis 1 is obvious. For hypothesis 2, let $f, g : B \rightarrow B$ and suppose there is no $t$
    such that $ft = gt$. Then define $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ by: $\alpha(x)$ is the directed line segment
    from $fx$ to $gx$.

    By the Brouwer Retraction Theorem, $j$ has no retraction. Therefore every endomap $B \rightarrow B$
    has a fixed point. \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem]
    Let $D$ be the closed disk. Every continuous endomap $D \rightarrow D$ has a fixed point.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    \pf\ Apply Corollary \ref{corollary:Brouwer} with $S$ the circle, $B$ the disk and $A$ the set of all
    directed line segments in $B$ of length $> 0$. Let $h : A \rightarrow B$ map any directed line segment to
    its head,
    $j : S \rightarrow A$ be the inclusion, and $p : A \rightarrow S$ be defined by: $p(a)$ is the point on
    the circle that $a$ points to.

    Hypothesis 1 is obvious. For hypothesis 2, let $f, g : B \rightarrow B$ and suppose there is no $t$
    such that $ft = gt$. Then define $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ by: $\alpha(x)$ is the directed line segment
    from $fx$ to $gx$.

    By the Brouwer Retraction Theorem, $j$ has no retraction. Therefore every endomap $B \rightarrow B$
    has a fixed point. \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem]
    Every continuous endomap from the solid ball to itself has a fixed point.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    \pf\ Apply Corollary \ref{corollary:Brouwer} with $S$ the sphere, $B$ the ball and $A$ the set of all
    directed line segments in $B$ of length $> 0$. Let $h : A \rightarrow B$ map any directed line segment to
    its head,
    $j : S \rightarrow A$ be the inclusion, and $p : A \rightarrow S$ be defined by: $p(a)$ is the point on
    the sphere that $a$ points to.

    Hypothesis 1 is obvious. For hypothesis 2, let $f, g : B \rightarrow B$ and suppose there is no $t$
    such that $ft = gt$. Then define $\alpha : B \rightarrow A$ by: $\alpha(x)$ is the directed line segment
    from $fx$ to $gx$.

    By the Brouwer Retraction Theorem, $j$ has no retraction. Therefore every endomap $B \rightarrow B$
    has a fixed point. \qed
