    \paragraph{Exercise 1}
    Many examples --- every instance of a product in a category gives an example. I will not list them.

    \paragraph{Exercise 2}
    I am not entirely sure what solution the authors had in mind. Here are some that come to my mind:

    Place a spirit level between the two points and see if it reads as level.

    Place a smooth plank between the two points and see if a ball placed at one point rolls to the other,
    or \emph{vice versa}.

    Hang a plumbline at each point and see if they form a right angle with the line joining the two points.

    Of these, the third is my favourite.
